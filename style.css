Notes:
                    The setup commands in terminal:

                    1. cd / theme_directory_location    // Browse to the theme directory

                    2. npm install                      // sudo npm install - for permissions issues

                    3. composer install                 // You may need to install composer first

                    4. setup dev.js                     // The dev url must be specified here for 'watch' to work

                    5. npm run build                    // Builds all the assets

                    6. npm run watch                    // Runs the browser sync

                    7. npm run build:production         // Build minimized assets for production use



Special Notes:      There are a few config variables / paths in webpack.config.js that needs to be changed per installation.

                    You can have .js files added to the 'dist' folder by adding them to 'webpack.config.js' ( see lines 38+ in there for instructions )
                    or you can add extra jQuery via 'assets/styles/main.js' directly by using it's load events, i.e if the body is home do something
                    load the file, take a look, you will get it.


                    All .scss files can be included within the 'assets/styles/main.scss' file to have it compiled & injected in to the js in development
                    or import it within the 'assets/styles/main.js' as a seporate file and still have it injected within the js. This only goes for
                    the front-end stuff. Admin only styles need to be done another way ( see bellow ).


                    As always you can use 'wp_enqueue_script' & 'wp_enqueue_style' within the 'src/helpers.php' to have them load within the theme.



To Do:              Learn how to have the 'custom-admin-style.scss' file auto complie & not have to use codekit to do it manually

                    UpUp scripts need to be copied to the WP root in order to work & require and valid SSL Certificate also
